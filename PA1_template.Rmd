## Data pre-processing
Loading the data
```{r cache=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
```
Explore the data
```{r}
summary(activity)
str(activity)
head(activity)
```
Count number of records with missing data
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
DailyTotalSteps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)
```
Visualize the trend
```{r}
p <- barplot(DailyTotalSteps)
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
summary(DailyTotalSteps)
```
The median total number of steps per day is 10,760, whereas the mean is 10,770.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
